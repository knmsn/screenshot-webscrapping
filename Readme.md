# HISOKA SCREENSHOT WEBSCRAPING

In this repository, I present the source code for software capable of taking a screenshot of a website using web scraping in a hidden manner with the Puppeteer library. The goal of this repository is to help the community grow while keeping my skills sharp by developing with JavaScript using NodeJS.

## Versions

**08/11/2020**

- [x] Hidden website screenshot capture based on the URL.
- [x] Dynamic naming, with support for changing both the extension and the name.

## Ideas for possible updates

- [ ] Create a while loop for website monitoring.
- [ ] Store photos in the cloud.

## How to use

- After cloning the repository, use the following command: `$ npm install`.
- To run the script, set the website URL for the screenshot in the script and run the command `$ node index.js`.
